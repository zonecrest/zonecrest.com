## The Landscape Has Shifted

You do not need another lecture on how fast AI is moving. You see it every day. New tools, new models, and new disruptions are launching weekly. 

For leadership teams, the challenge is no longer *access* to technology—it is **strategic clarity**. 

While others are distracted by the hype of the latest tools, market leaders are asking the hard questions:
* How do we integrate AI without exposing our data?
* Which use cases actually drive ROI vs. just wasting time?
* How do we build a governance framework that scales?

**Knowing change is coming is different from knowing how to direct it.**
